- This is a Pyhton program that works on the concept of Projection Of Lines in a Cartesian Plane.
- First, the user enters the coordinates of the line in (x, y, z) form in a tkinter window and its corresponding projection 
  is displayed in the cartesian plane using mplot3D library from the matplotlib package in a separate tkinter window.
- Along with the graph, the line’s corresponding true length, front view length, top view length, angles of inclination with HP and VP , 
  angle of inclination of Front View with HP and angle of inclination of Top View with VP is also displayed.

In the code:
here,  A = (x1,y1,z1)
       B = (x2,y2,z2)
- AB = True length of the line(TL in the picture)
- ab = top view length of the line( PL in the pic.)
- a’b’ = front view length of the line( EL in the pic.)
- ‘l’ also denotes the z-axis
- ‘h’ also denotes the y - axis
- and, ‘b’ also denotes the x-axis
- I have made my logic by constructing a imaginary box using l, b, h.
-  alpha is the angle that a’b’ makes with z-axis
- beta is the angle that ab makes with z- axis
