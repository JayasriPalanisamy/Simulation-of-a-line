# Simulation-of-a-line
Simulation of a line in the Engineering Graphics Subject in 3 - D using mplot3D in Python
The project focuses on simulating a line in the 3-D plane using mplot3D and also taking its reflections in the Horizontal Plane, Vertical Plane and Side Plane. Also, it is interactively built with Tkinter for users to enter the values. It calculates the necessary angles made with the plane, the length of the line and its reflections.
